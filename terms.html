            non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple's Standard End User
                License Agreement (EULA)</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Prayer Times Disclaimer</h2>
        <div class="highlight-card">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Prayer times provided by PrayNow are calculated using mathematical algorithms
                and are intended as a helpful reference. They may vary from times announced by local mosques or
                religious authorities. PrayNow does not guarantee the absolute accuracy of prayer times, and you should
                verify them with your local Islamic authority when precision is critical.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Qibla Direction Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Qibla compass feature relies on your device's magnetometer and GPS. Results may be affected by magnetic
            interference, device calibration, or environmental factors. The direction shown is an approximation and
            should not be relied upon as the sole method of determining Qibla.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Use the App only for its intended purpose as a personal prayer companion.</li>
            <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the App.</li>

            not control Apple's iCloud service and are not responsible for any data loss, sync issues, or outages
            related to iCloud. Your use of iCloud is subject to <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/">Apple's iCloud Terms</a>.</p>

        <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
